# Horiseon-Refactor
Cleaning up html and css in Horiseon page

## Description

The Horiseon website was visually appealing, but was not very accessible, especially for unsighted users. My goal was to make the webpage more accessible without changing it visually. I also simplified both the html and css in order to make it easier for future developers to handle and update.

## Installation and Usage

There is no installation required. It is a simple webpage that can be interacted with via the navigation bar.

## Credits

I worked on the html and css on my own, and received some very helpful tips for deploying the site from my classmates in the UCSD Extension coding bootcamp.

## License

I received the starting html, css, and images from the UCSD Extension Coding Bootcamp Repository on Gitlab.
